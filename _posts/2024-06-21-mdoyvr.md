In June 2024, I attended the [MDOYVR](https://mdoyvr.com) conference in Vancouver.

I rarely get the chance to attend converences outside Australia so this was a great opportunity to meet some of the people I've only ever interacted with online. I also got to speak about swiftDialog and Outset.

Mat X and team did a great job on the event. All the videos are up on youtube so you can check them out on the [MDO channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MDOYVR)

Here's my presentations:

#### swiftDialog workshop
