Many in the mac admin space make use of open source tools. Whether it's software like munki, autopkg or eraseinstall or even someone elses script, we rely on the shared work of others to get our jobs done.

In May 2024, I spoke at [X World Melbourne](https://auc.edu.au/xworld/about/) about the journey of creating and maintaining open source software. I was also able to give a workshop on how macadmins can get started using swiftDialog. This was the first time I had given a workshop and it was a great experience with some great feedback. This wasn't recorded for X World but I did give the same workshop at the [MacDevOpsYVR](https://mdoyvr.com) conference in Vancouver in June which was recorded and is available on the [MDO youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MDOYVR). 

### So You Want to Make an Open Source App

> This talk is for those that are thinking about releasing their work as open source or anyone that wants to know what goes in to creating and supporting free software.
> 
> I'll go over topics from creating something from scratch, taking over an existing project or even contributing to someone elses work. I'll then look at options for publishing your work, what licenses are in use, getting access to resources like Macadmins Opensource (https://macadmins.io). Lastly I'll look at the realities of ongoing maintenance, what to expect, how to interact with your customers, how, as a customer, to interact with developers and other highs and lows of running an open source project.
